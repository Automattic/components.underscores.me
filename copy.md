# Components

## Want to build a WordPress theme turbo-fast?

Components is a library of shareable, reusable patterns for WordPress themes. Instead of starting from scratch, mix and match to build your own custom starter theme. Think of it as your scaffolding. We build the foundation and wire everything upâ€”you move in and paint the walls.

## Is Components right for me?

Components is designed for WordPress theme enthusiasts of all levels. If you're just starting out, it'll get you started without needing to reinvent the wheel or build a lot of custom code. If you're an experienced theme developer, you'll find well-organised, easy-to use code that you can remix to your heart's delight!


## Let's get you a theme!

We've got some pre-fab packages for five common theme types. If that's not quite what you're after, you can [download everything instead.](#download-all)

#### Modern blog

You think the world could be a little bit less cluttered. You like clean lines, simple shapes, and xxx. You want the focus to be on your content, not a lot of other stuff. With a single-column layout, a large featured image, and a slide-out panel for widgets and navigation, a modern blog is the perfect fit for you.

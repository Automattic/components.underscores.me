Components
===

I run the components.underscores.me website and I generate pretty cool WordPress themes so you can create something awesome.

## Working on the Components site

To build the styles (we use SCSS), you'll need to install [node/npm](http://nodejs.org/). Install the dependencies using npm:

`bash
npm install
`

You can now build the styles using `npm run build`. To watch for style changes while you're developing the styles, use `npm start` and gulp will rebuild your `styles.css` file every time you make a change.
